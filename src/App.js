        <h3> :) HELLO FIRST FUNEMPLOYMENT PROJECT :) </h3>

        <p>Hi, my name is Jon. My Korean name is Jisung,
          and it was the name I grew up using until I was 17
          when I got my US citizenship.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to federal budgets cuts earlier in the year,
          the company I worked at for about 4 years was affected
          and I was laid off.
        </p>

        <p>
          Surpisingly enough, I've been wholeheartedly enjoying
          my funemployment. I've been learning to bake loaves of bread and
          restore (basic) furniture. I've been tending to my patio garden
          and taking my dog on longer walks.
        </p>

        <p>
          This [event] did give me a clearer headspace to re-evaluate my personal goals,
          including those as a web developer. I've always looked to work my background in
          graphic design into my dev work where I can, so I decided to build a mini component library
          as a fun personal project / portfolio piece. I used Figma to design my components 
          and Storybook to build and style them.
