# Jon's site, featuring mini ui kit

Hello! This repo contains code for my personal site, featuring a mini UI Kit that I designed in Figma and built in Storybook. It was a project that I started during my [ period of unemployment ] to both maintain my web dev skills and learn web design.

### Getting Started ###
To view the components in Storybook, please follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jisung594/mini-component-library`
2. Go to project root: `cd mini-component-library`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the dev server: `npm start`
5. Run Storybook: `npm run storybook`
